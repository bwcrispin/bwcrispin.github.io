                    About
                </h2>
                <p>I am a slightly nerdy yet friendly guy who lives in Columbus, OH.  I enjoy video games, reading, hoping the Crew will once again hoist the MLS trophy, and imagining the Browns will one day be good.</p></br>
                <p>I have always been interested in technology, and have worked many years in IT Support.  However, I have made the decision to attend <a href="https://wecancodeit.org/">We Can Code IT</a> in here in Columbus to focus my interest in coding and fulfill my desire to be a developer.</p></br>
                <p>I am also interested in how software can help fill the needs of people in the community.  I've been able to attend Code for Columbus to work with others who want to use the smart data of Columbus to help make a difference.</p>
